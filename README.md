# Purple-soft-rice
dot files for my SwayWM rice
**colours do not represent what they look like on my screen** My laptop is colour calibrated to make everything softer on my eyes. If you see these screenshots on a phone on desktop, or implement my hexes they wont look like how they do on my screen, but closer to the screenshots. These are the raw images of my screen. no editing. This is how they may look on your pc, i reccomend toning everything the darker bluish purple!
